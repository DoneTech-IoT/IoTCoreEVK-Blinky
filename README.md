# IoTCoreEVK-Blinky

This project demonstrates how to create a visually interesting effect using an RGB LED. The LED blinks in rapid succession with red, green, and blue colours, creating the appearance of a combined colour due to the human eye's persistence of vision. The blinking sequence repeats every 5 seconds.

## Features
- **Dynamic Blinking**: RGB LED blinks with red, green, and blue colours in quick succession.
- **Blending Effect**: A 50ms delay between colour transitions creates a combined colour perception.
- **Timed Sequence**: A 5-second interval between each blink sequence ensures a consistent cycle.

## Requirements
- **Hardware:** IoTCore EVK board by Done.IoT.  
- **Software:** pre-installed ESP-IDF v5.3.2 development environment ([ESP-IDF Installation Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html#build-your-first-project)).
